# Portfolio

*Sord-dev's portfolio*

My web development portfolio, feel free to look at tech I used c:

## Architecture
These are the technologies I used to create this portfolio.

 - React
 - ThreeJS
 - EmailJS
 - ChakraUI
 - Framer Motion
 - TS Particles
 - NextJS

## Features

 - Live Project Updates via Github API
 - Interactive Particles
 - Light and Dark Mode

## Lessons Learned

This project taught me how streamlined the development process can be using create-next-app in leiu of create-react-app, not only was the routing solution very efficient and easy to work with but the deployment time of a dev server is practically a fraction of it's counterpart.
